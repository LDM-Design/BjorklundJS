# BjorklundJS
A little JS code to create a Euclidean rhythmic sequence as described by Godfried Toussaint here - http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~godfried/publications/banff.pdf. An array is created from 2 inputs - sequence length and number of beats. 

I was not satisifed with other examples I found and wanted this to accurately follow the exact steps in the article.
